  "description": "This is a Mock API for the HRLab timetracking feature. It contains all relevant endpoints for fetching and logging working times. The workinghours are logged for a given user and optionally a project. \n\nThere are only two ways to interact with the timetracking: starting (POST) and stopping (PUT) it. \nThe tracked workinghours are saved as worktime (action 'work'). The Server automatically fills up the in between times as breaks (action 'pause')",
